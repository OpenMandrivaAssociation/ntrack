	ntrack version 015 released!

	Homepage: https://launchpad.net/ntrack
	Release: https://launchpad.net/ntrack/main/015
	Download: http://launchpad.net/ntrack/main/015/+download/ntrack-015.tar.gz
	TODO: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ntrack

	ntrack 015 is a long expected release that started low, but ended up coming out
	strong. This is not only because a first experimental revision of our next gen
        backend for linux, rtnetlink, got included.

	Early testing indicates that rtnetlink really has the potential to leave out
	the flaky libnl middleware alltogether and get network state info first hand
	from the kernel. Once stabilized and properly field tested, This will clearly
	contribute to a more complete, consistent and reliable ntrack experience.

	Nevertheless, ntrack 015 also grows more complete libnl support and can now
	build backends for libnl 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 (NEW), 3.2.x (NEW) and latest git
	(NEW).

	See below for info what bugs were fixed on top for this release.

	Fixed Bugs:
	 * lp:750554 - nl modules are not linked with libntrack even if they use symbols from it
	 * lp:755608 - Ntrack dead loop in function get_nl_link_by_index
	 * lp:834639 - Build failure with -Werror=strict-aliasing
	 * lp:774690 - Build error in a fresh environment
	 * lp:785119 - ntrack can get into endless poll loop if no backend modules found
	 * lp:801407 - ntrack-014 compilation fails if all libnl[123] are present together
	 * lp:448400 - add pure rtnetlink backend for linux
	 * lp:879141 - support libnl 3.1

	Known Issues:
	 * no Qt python wrappers yet - lp:505672

	information about version, author, copyright and backend; the build
        system grew support for pld-linux.org, a few other refinements. For

	 * lp:743879 - ntrack 013 doesn't build with libnl 3.0

	ntrack version 012 released!

	TODO: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ntrack

	This release is a bug fix release with three focus areas:
	 * libnl2 module - here, code was ported to final 2.0 API
	 * lifecycle management - fixes memory leaks for monitor and listener_packs
	 * general stabilization - memory leak rework required some stabilization work
	 * developer convenience - improve macros and API for writing ntrack backend modules

	Note: this release breaks build for debian squeeze and ubuntu maverick/natty
	libnl2-dev package; that's because debian/ubuntu packaged a non-final 1.99+git
	snapshot and didn't take precautions wrt SONAME and .pc file version to allow
	to support this version; libnl2 changed API for 2.0 final release and so ntrack
	had to unsupport those versions; anyway, they still have libnl1 as default
	installed so this isn't a big problem; if you need support for those preview
	libnl2 packages for some reason anyway, just revert bzr rev269 from lp:ntrack.

	Fixed Bugs:
	 * lp:694823 - fails to ./configure with gobject if pygobject depends are not installed
	 * lp:736058 - ntrack 011 does not compile with libnl2 final
	 * lp:694477 - new plugin API: introduce modules function table and macros to implement modules

	Known Issues:
	 * no Qt python wrappers yet - lp:505672

	ntrack version 011 released!

	Homepage: https://launchpad.net/ntrack
	Release: https://launchpad.net/ntrack/main/011
	Download: http://launchpad.net/ntrack/main/011/+download/ntrack-011.tar.gz
	TODO: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ntrack

	This release focusses on making ntrack build with old toolchain and autotools
	from hardy. Various changes were needed to get it build there. Side product of this
	is that we wrapped a new option -enable-developer-build into this build. Using this
	option will tell configure that this is a developer build and that the module loader
	should consider typical source tree directories when looking for loadable backend
	modules. Please ensure you don't keep this option around for production builds.

	Fixed Bugs:
	 * lp:693215 - Makefile.am files are not automake 1.7 friendly in ntrack 010
	 * lp:693214 - various hardy build problems caused by code + triggering
	               warnings for gcc 4.2
	 * lp:693500 - autogen.sh and make distcheck broken for hardy

	Known Issues:
	 * no Qt python wrappers yet - lp:505672

	ntrack version 010 released!

	TODO: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ntrack

	This release adds support for libnl-2.0 and introduces a runtime loadable
	modules API for implementing ntrack backends. This lead to a few code cleanups
	and refactoring. API is not considered stable enough to export as a public API.
	But build/code wise this is already prepared; once the API can be frozen
	backends can be contributed from outside of ntrack.

	Fixed Bugs:
	* lp:661769 - building in a build/ directory fails to find pyntrack-gmonitor.override 
	* lp:686554 - change from deprecated libnl-1 to libnl-2
	* lp:692703 - mtest-gmonitor.py segfauls in latest lp:ntrack revno. 235
	* lp:692245 - add support for pluggable backends

	Known Issues:
